Just call me Rad like everybody else.</p> <p>I always had a passion for technology, so I have started studying Computer Science at Wroclaw University of Technology. After graduating I wanted to work with networks and system administration, but I quickly realised that I am much more interested in software development. Because of that I dusted of my programing books and started pursuing that exact career.</p><p>I enjoy researching new technologies to stay up to date, and deliver the best software and user experience possible. I am mostly working with .NET Framework, Azure and React.js but I also worked with Java and Objective C. Lately I am working in a startup that helps companies to understand their customer base.</p><p>Privately I'm an adrenaline junkie and I enjoy downhill, mountain biking, climbing and other extreme sports and activities. I own a husky named Serj, so I have to stay in shape to keep up with him during our daily walks or rather runs. As you can see I spend a lot of my free time outside \"enjoying\" Scottish weather. And yes, you guessed it! My general health and immunity is excellent!</p>");
